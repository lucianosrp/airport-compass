# The Airport Compass

## Inspiration
3 years ago I got inspired by a very interesting figure published on a paper by [@gboeing](https://github.com/gboeing) called [Urban spatial order: street network orientation, configuration, and entropy](https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-019-0189-1)


![Figure](https://i0.wp.com/geoffboeing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/city-street-orientations-world-osmnx.png?ssl=1)

This figure represents the distribution of the orientation of every major street of a city.

I like how it gives a quick representation of each cities'
layout and how evident are the various levels of entropy.

Shortly after seeing this chart I immediately though of replicating this view but for airports' traffic worldwide.
